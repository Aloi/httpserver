Losely based on the JSR-154 interfaces which is used in Java for handling HTTP lifecycle management, the HTTP Server manages requests and responses for your PHP application. 

The HTTP Server provides core HTTP classes to PHP, such as the Request and Response classes, as well as providing a structure for calling your application code (as objects). The HTTP Server also provides Filters and Filter Chains for you to implement reusable behaviour, such as routing requests, handling security or transforming the response.

The HTTP Server aims to be a light-weight handler for the request/response, and invoke different parts of your application. This allows you to chose the correct approach to building your application without forcing a full-MVC stacked response like many other frameworks.
